#### Framework for rapid frontend development, waxed as mustache.
<hr>
Is a toolbox which allows PHP developer to easily prototype rich interactive web applications without too much fiddling with javascript and css.
Contains curated and growing collection of frontend solutions for many typical scenarios - all driven from PHP code.


In the heart there is good old mustache templating:
```html
  {{#data}}
     <h1>{{title}}</h1><p>{{text}}</p>
  {{/data}}    

```

...but, there is much more.
